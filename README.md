# ICA of subsidence InSAR time series

This code executes ICA on LiCSBAS InSAR time series analysis outputs.

Following ICA, inelastic components of subsidence are identified.

Identified components are saved in a netCDF file as well as tif files.

This release accompanies work by Payne et al., submitted to JGR Solid Earth.
